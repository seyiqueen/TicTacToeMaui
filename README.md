# MAUI EXAMPLE: TIC-TAC-TOE

Tic-Tac-Toe is an open-source project that provides an example for a simple application using .NET MAUI (.NET Multi-platform App UI).    Most of the code in C#, XAML, and unit testing was performed using  XUnit.   The game is based on the paper and pencil version of TIC-TAC-TOE that I played when I was young.   I made it because I wanted to create my first .NET MAUI application, where most of my time is spent as a professional WPF developer.  The logic used for the computer playing the game is designed on the principle of not losing rather than trying to win.          

# Possible Future Changes

If I have time in the future, there are a few things that I was wanting to add:

  •	Ability for the user to pick wether they want to be X or O.

  •	Add a shaking effect when the user clicks down on the X or O.

  •	Add a small delay before the computer plays.

  •	Add the ability for the computer to occasionally loose, currently it never does.
